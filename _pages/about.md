I am a recent graduate of Michigan State University with degrees in physics and advanced mathematics. I will be attending the Weizmann Institute of Science to pursue an M.Sc. and eventually a Ph.D. in physics. My research interests include quantum physics, quantum field theory, many-body physics, and astrophysics.
